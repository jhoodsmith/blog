I am a computer scientist and software developer working in and around London.
The intended audience for this blog is for the most part my future self, with
the posts serving as reminders for how to get things done. That said, if you
find anything here useful, feel I've got something wrong or just want to talk
shop, then please feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/jhoodsmith).
